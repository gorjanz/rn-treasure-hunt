# rn-treasure-hunt
React Native application to support a real-world Treasure Hunt game.

The basic flow of the game can be summarized as follows:
- A setup for a session is done on the server via an interactive form ( coming soon... )
- Login information is given to each participant
- At each checkpoint, you need to solve a puzzle (real world or online, depending on the requirements)
- After the participant enters the passphrase, a new checkpoint is unlocked.
- The participant / team, has the option to take photos during the game and upload them to a private pre-configured server

The app is fully customizable and can be branded easily.
